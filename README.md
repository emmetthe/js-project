# js-project

## Background
This project was made using vanilla Javascript and HTML Canvas. In this game, the player will use their keyboard to move around(WASD for up, left, down, right respectively). The goal of this game is to allow the chickens to successfully cross the road. Everytime a chicken does not make it across the road, the player loses a life. The game will end when the player has run out of lives.

## Functionality & MVPs

In this project, users will be able to:

- play the game with their keyboard
- pause/restart the game at any time
- see their current and highest score
- shoot projectiles and incoming objects using their mouse

In addition, this project will include:

- a README
- a background of the game along with various features
